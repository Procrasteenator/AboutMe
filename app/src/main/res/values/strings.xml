    <string name ="my_bio">Hello my name is Devansh and
        \nI am learning Android Development.
        \n I started Learning Android Development during my freshmen year
    \n and since then I am constantly learning and making basic apps
     I made a Login and Registration System as a part of my Freshmen Year End Project
    \n The app uses Firebase to save registered users name , email and password
    \n If the user is registered  it moves to the welcome screen
    \n Otherwise a Toast pops up with a message that the user is not registered
    \n Besides that I made a simple Dice app which on clicking the button gives a us value
    on the dice and also as a toast
    \n That\'s all for now
    \n right now working on this About ME app which uses scroll view to show text .
    \n
